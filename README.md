Demo EOS Contracts

My plan is to release contracts here that one could use as a starting point.  I found myself very frustrated with the documentation available for more advanced contracts so as I build things I will put them here to support planned tutorials.  The current token contract with the ability to handle token sales is still under development and should not be used yet.  Unless you know what you are doing. It was posted early by request of someone.

There are some set up scripts for vscode that should make your life a little easier if you have never worked with contracts before but are familiar with vscode.
